Parabot 317-API-Minified ImaginePS
========================

A tiny 317 API for Parabot v2 for ImaginePS

### About

This API uses as few as possible hooks. This means that adding obfuscated clients requires less work now. This provider invokes the client#doAction(int) method so performing tasks is possible without any mouse/key input and thus does not require world location (tiles) to screen calculations.

### Issues
If you've an issues regarding the hooks, please report them [here](https://github.com/Parabot/Parabot-317-API-Minified/issues).

#### Maven
Parabot supports Maven as of September 2015. All information is included in the POM.xml.
The API that is supported by Parabot is also published on a Maven repository.
If you'd like to have either or both the client and the API in your project, use the following repository and dependecy tags:
